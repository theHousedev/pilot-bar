# Pilot Bar
A tool for inserting aviation weather data into Waybar.

## Current project state
Minimal CLI fetch of METAR. Skeleton of basic package structure.

## Short Term Goals
- Live fetch of a complete assortment of weather data for a selected airport
- Highly configurable:
  - Component selection: fetch the minimum data **you** want to see
  - Component updates: adjust frequency as desired (supplied with sensible defaults)
- General Waybar integration

## Future Goals
- Auto-location detection
- Multi-airport
- "Welcome" weather:
  - Pre-login
  - Lock screen
  - Screensaver
- Raw data translation for readable components
